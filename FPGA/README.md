# Hardware Implementation
## Platform
We implement the hardware version of Erasable Sketch (i.e., Erasable-hw Sketch) on the Alveo U280 Data Center accelerator card (xcu280-fsvh2892-2L-e).
## Description
We provide C++ codes for hardware implementation here, which can be directly synthesized into Verilog codes using Vivado HLS.
